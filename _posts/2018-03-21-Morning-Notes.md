# Wednesday morning breakout group activity

### Alpha/Beta Group
* Looking at species area break-point models
* Island archipelago, smaller area island species richness is all colonization, larger islands
speciation becomes more important (Losos/Schluter)
* local community structure at the alpha and also beta level.
* Threshold where increasing area facilitates local speciation
    * Or maybe the inflection point doesn't represent when speciation kicks in, but it does inflect still (cichlids)
* How to account for time? How to account for rate of local diversification?
* Less diversification/more diversification on the x-axis, so it could be area or time, or both.
* Looking for plot level data across archipelagos
* Insular systems where local diversification is relevant
* If sequence data is available it might be possible to slap on Fst in addition to beta diversity, to explain increase in richness with area.
* Is the archipelago a hotspot or not, interested in exploring other (continental) datasets?
* Accounting for lumpy vs splitty taxa
* Products
    * One paper with Luke leading. Data analysis. Review/Synthesis (maybe a model component). 
    * Meta-analysis/mixed model including trees (HI), Azores insects, galapagos, anything else they can get hands on

### Radiations
* Data analysis
    * Taking big phylogenies including both island and mainland slices to ask questions about diversification within the island
    * Compare island and mainland clades of similar ages to identify whether there's something special in the clade structure that explains radiation propensity.
    * Somehow incorporating abundances
    * Somehow incorporating Fst
    * Do lineages that radiate in islands have closely related lineages that radiate in the mainland?
    * **When is the mainland the mainland?**
* Model
    * Gavrilets and Voehs extension (a complicated model of radiations on islands, different resources, different resource preferences)
    * generates predictions of macroevolution and macroecology
    * We don't like the speciation concept in this model, so we could build a better speciation mechanism.
* Could it be that truly neutral individual based models could generate phylogenies that sometimes generate clades that radiate wildly?
* Products
    * Large analysis of islands that include taxonomic and phylogenetic data (including island birds and trees)
    * Which radiations are endemic which are singletons.
    * Need regional species level tree that represents potential colonists
    * Another product could be a more advanced model. Whether to incorporate this in the MESS model is an open question. Whether to construct as an individual model or a species model is also an open question.

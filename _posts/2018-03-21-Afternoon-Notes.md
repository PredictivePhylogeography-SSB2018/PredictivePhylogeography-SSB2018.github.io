## Authorship
* Emphasize enclusiveness
* Unequeal contribution
    * Folks can opt-out based on the honor system of contribution
* Main papers
    * Opt-out: everybody should assume they are an author unless you opt-out, for whatever reason.
* Spin-off papers
    * Should avoid getting dog-piled on excessively by everybody co-authoring on everything 
    * Spin off papers shouldn't be dragged down by people who aren't doing anything
* Equal contribution
    * Equal contribution squabbles should be resolved by "Equal-contribution starring"

## Data availability
* Hoping for data to be available whenver possible.
* We aren't going to kick out datasets or force them to be open, but we want to encourage openness.

## Paper Ideas
* Luke 1 - (Alpha/Beta group) - What causes species richness to accumulate at a different rate in larger communities?
    * Role of evolutionary history in structuring ecological communities on islands.
    * How does alpha diversity change with the size of a region as a function of contributions from immigration vs in situ diversification?
* No Lead - (Radiations Group) - Do lineages that radiate in islands have closely related lineages that radiate in the mainland?
* No Lead - (Radiations Group) - Gavrilets and Vose + a better model of speciation
    * This idea could easily be folded into the MESS model instead of carved off as a seperate thing
* No Lead - (Arose out of Tuesday AM Discussion) - Big over-arching bullshitty framework paper
    * Jon and Luke will joint-first author, but Luke will be first-first.
* No Lead - (Arose out of discussion) - MaxEnt + Island age (blow up andy's model into a bunch of different islands).
* No Lead - (Diversification Group, related to the Speciation & Abundance idea from SFI) - 

### Papers proposed during the SFI meeting
* Use the MESS model to generate new summary statistics (SAD, SAR, Tree imbalance, diversification slow-down statistics).
* MESS Model
    * HI Arthropods
    * HI Trees
    * Meta-analysis of global datasets (Breeding bird survey)
* Andy - Ground truthing METE
* Katie & Luke - Speciation & Abundance (diversification scales with area, but sometimes it doesn't)
* No Lead - What are patterns under extremes of the model?

## General Chatter
* Afternoon Breakout groups - Framework, invasions alpha/beta scaling, modelling alpha/beta scaling


## Afternoon quotes
**The amount of work required to do science is much than us just sitting here for five days.**
**The idea is to have allopatric diversification of ideas.**

## Results from the morning discussion about important eco-evolutionary questions

### Group 1
* How does system size determine community assembly on evolutionary timescales? 
* What are the mechanisms that drive radiations?
* What is the effect of island ontogeny in determining present-day biodiversity patterns?
* What determines resistance to invasion?  
* Where is the diversity emerging, at the alpha level or at the beta level? Corrolary: Where do novel ecotypes come from? From evolution or dispersal?

### Group 3
Question of whether we should limit ourselves by what is possible with the current modelling strategy.
It would be nice to try linking the questions to conservation.

* Are clade age and species richness correlated?
* What are the limits to species richness?
* Area vs diversification/speciation/extinction (classic M&W)
* Invasions?
* Alpha/Beta diversity
* Why do some groups disperse and others not?
* Are there limits to predictability of ecosystems?
* Effects of island ontogeny and human activity on extinction, speciation, colonization, and diversification?

RE: The diagram - Mixing rates, data, and concepts. Mixing process and pattern. An organizational principle would be useful.

### Group 4
**"I'm not going to defend this already published paper, that I'm not an author on, that's clearly in a really nice journal."**

* How do particular radiations stand out or deviate from theoretical predictions?
* What is the ultimate rate limiting factor of adaptive radiations?
* What's predictive in the ecological patterns across taxonomic scales similar or different?
* What are limits to species richness?
* Why might some habitat structures differentially resist invasion?
* What are the conditions underlying repeatability?
* Is there a relationship between abundance and speciation rate, as assumed by neutral theory?
    * Ecological winners and evolutionary losers. (See Katie's comments in the google sheet).
* Does diversification rate scale with area?
* Can we distinguish between local coexistence niche shifts and habitat heterogeneity niche shifts? (Reword).
* Evolved vs assembled communities.
* What's predictive in the mechanisms that drive radiations?
* What's the role of speciation in modifying networks?

**Try to get some of these questions formulated in more of a predictive fashion.**

**In your mind, what is the difference between a box and an arrow?**
**The boxes sort things out and the arrows bring back the chaos.**
**What's the difference between a model and a framework?** - **A framework is a more useful model.**

### Interest in pairs of framework boxes (ranked)
Abundance/Richness Group is highest
Environmental Heterogeneity/Speciation/Extinction/Colonization
Niches/Speciation/Extinction/Colonization

### Eco-evolutionary framework
Justification: Macroevolution is going on and microevolution is going on and we've been doing a very bad job of putting them together.

**We need to implement the MOSS model as well.**

 
### Alpha/Beta Modelling group

relate alpha/beta/gamma diversity from an evolutionary neutral model
* 3 part paper
    * simple abstract spatially implicit model (analytical)
    * spatially explicit model
    * Emperical example

* Discussion about the kinds of data we might need
    * Is this kink driven mainly by ecology or mainly by evolution
    * The data might be a little tricky to maintain
    * In HI the islands are different age, but we need multiple islands that are the same ish age
    * Ideally plot level data (abundance of taxa)
    * Maybe piece together data from the austral islands, the galapagos, and cichlids

### Alpha/Beta empirical group
* How to represent evolutionary diversity within the system,
    * reltaive contribution of evolutionary diversity to alhpa and gamma
    * extremes - spatial threshold of whether or not insitu contributes to R at gamma scale and how
    * hotspots provide a different problem, how much diversification has happened over time. Time is the proxy for evolutionary contribution of diversification.
* Class systems into one category or the other
    * integrate area component and time component?
    * leaning toward a meta-approach
    * Look for effect size with slightly different predictors?
* How to standardize plot sampling to reduce area driven sampling effects?
    * Islands with vastly different sizes will have size driven diversity patterns that could interfere
    * Looking at patterns that arise from HI trees for example and how to account for area scaling effects
* Definitions for in situ diversification (to make sure what constitutes within island speciation actually is agreed on by data contributors).
* If you have 20 or 100 plots across an area instead of 10 plots and you average them are you really averaging the same thing? this is the scaling problem.

**"Stratification: good in sampling bad in society."**

### Abundance/Diversification: Why Radiate?
* What's the relationship between local and global abundance, abundance and range size, and different kinds of rarity, how does this impact persistence?
* RElate this to other questios? Speciation slow-downs (birth-death gives one answer, zero sum gives another)
* Theoretical analysis:
    * Neutral model - Fragmented metacommunity and look at per capita speciation rate, how does fragmentation impact speciation rate
    * Habitat patches connected by migration and relation to abundance and speciation rate correlation.
    * Larger ranges come from more abundant species because there are more individuals to diffuse
* Empirical analysis:
    * Looked at some HI data.
    * Abundance/Diversity correlation? Does abundance drive or dampen speciation?
    * Heterogeneity: If there's heterogeneity, then widespread species might be more likely to diversify.
    * Looking at Ne instead of sample abundance.
* Low hanging fruit: Island diversification compared to mainland diversification
    * Sampling clades from island and mainland to ask whether islands are exceptional w/ respect to mainlands.
    * Sister clade radiation propensity
    * Thinking about looking at birds and plants because of the volume of data.

**"I'm surprised it hasn't been done." "Well it hasn't been done by us."**

### General Chatter

**"There's no way the snail crawled up the volcano."**

**"The island looks huge if you're a nematode."**

**"We're six minutes late, but that's Berkeley early...."**

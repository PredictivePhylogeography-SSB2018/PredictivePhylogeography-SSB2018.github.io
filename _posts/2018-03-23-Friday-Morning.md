### Population genetics
* Any time colonization or hybridization is involved polymorhpism data will be useful.

### Niches
* We kind of sidelined niches a little bit, but we should keep this in mind as we progress toward August.

### Talk about planning for the future.
* [Data Sets Available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XebsJIGAcpBTcUUcurlw4-KKIDNA-G1DUk_eApqLZ9M/edit#gid=399731184)
* Groups should indicate somehow which datasets they are interested in using and the datatypes they want to use:
    * Open data conversation

**"There's lots of different kinds of 'no'"**

## Speciation/Abundance Breakout Group
* Who's going to lead this paper? Is it one or two papers?
    * It's really 2 papers: The empirical paper (Katie), and the modelling paper (Andy)
* Abundance/Area, Abundance/Time, Abundance/Speciation/Range Size
* Katie has some Cichlid data that might be useful for testing this.
* It would be nice to positively construct a hypothesis relating Abundance/Area/Speciation/Range Size that doesn't just fall out as an emergent property of neutral theory stealing from population genetics theory.

**"You steal from popgen and that's what you get!"**

* SGD should be SED, maybe.
* Distribution of ancestral abundances that are distributed in a way that makes sense, rather than uniform.

### The Katie paper
* Proposed title: Effect of commonness and rarity on diversification dynamics in radiating clades.
    * Intro: discuss commonness and rarity in response to abundance and range size, and the background of this somewhat with respect to range size but especially the paleo perspective on this.
    * Commonness rarity and range size different quantifications and how they're related.
    * Connection to theories of abundance and speciation (neutral theory) and connection to empirical work in paleo.
    * "There's no way to decide without empirical data."
* For the analyses: HI data, Cichlids, Galapagos gastropods

**"I'm good at making paper outlines."**

* Chichlids
    * Maybe abundance, def phylogenies, good popgen data, good information about what lakes each fish is in, and lake-based "Occupancy by fish"

**"If you lower your standards and start thinking about ecological things...."**

    * Is speciation still ongoing?

## How to bring macroecology back into macroevolution
* Assumptions of Ne as something that messes up phylogenetic inference. If you assume Ne is fixed across species, could this introduce skew in the inference? If Ne was distributed more realistically could you see the inference of the same tree that results in less inference of hybridization?
* What do people assume about population size when people do gene tree/species tree inference?

## Chatter

**"Extravaganza of optimism."**

**"Despite it not being a good idea generally, I think it _is_ a good idea here."**

**"It's an agreed upon simplicity."**

**"Everything is idiosyncratic."**

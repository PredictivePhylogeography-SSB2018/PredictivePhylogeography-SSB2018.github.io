### Predictive Pyhlogeography

A common approach to understanding the phylogeographic history of an organism, or complex of organisms, is to estimate genetic diversity across a geographic area in which the organism(s) reside. This can involve estimating a number of population genetic statistics and potentially comparing several phylogeographic models and performing demographic model selection.

Predictive phylogeography can be used when genetic data for a species of interest is unavailable. In this case, other information such as bioclimatic varaibles and life history traits can

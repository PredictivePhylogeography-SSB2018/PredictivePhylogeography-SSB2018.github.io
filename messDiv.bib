                  (SAD) is fundamental in ecology, but few spatially
                  explicit models of this pattern have thus far been
                  studied. Here we show spatially explicit neutral
                  model predictions for SADs over a wide range of
                  spatial scales, which appear to match empirical
                  patterns qualitatively. We find that the assumption
                  of a log-series SAD in the metacommunity made by
                  spatially implicit neutral models can be justified
                  with a spatially explicit model in the large area
                  limit. Furthermore, our model predicts that SADs on
                  multiple scales are characterized by a single,
                  compound parameter that represents the ratio of the
                  survey area to the species’ average biogeographic
                  range (which is in turn set by the speciation rate
                  and the dispersal distance). This intriguing
                  prediction is in line with recent empirical evidence
                  for a universal scaling of the species-area
                  curve. Hence we hypothesize that empirical SAD
                  patterns will show a similar universal scaling for
                  many different taxa and across multiple spatial
                  scales.",
